# BubbleSortSaga
A sample python program to demonstrate a simple bubble sort, originally written by Gary of 'Gary Explains' on YouTube:

I've transcribed it from Gary's video to accompany a blog post I'm writing at:

I changed it a bit here and there to run smoothly using Python3 as well as adding some sleep(1) lines to make the output more readable when run.
